Subject: Quick question—certificate expiry headaches?

Hi [First Name],

I’m Ivan, ex-Kpler (MarineTraffic) and now building tools to tackle maritime compliance—specifically, the chaos of tracking vessel certificates across fleets.

When I spoke to [Competitor X]’s ops team last week, they admitted a $28k detention fee from an expired cert they missed in spreadsheets. Ouch.

How’s your team handling this?

Still manually checking expiry dates?

Any close calls with Port State Control?

*No pitch—just trading war stories. If you reply, I’ll share a cheat sheet of the most commonly overlooked certificates (based on 30+ fleet manager interviews).*

Either way, thanks for your time—this industry runs on shared scars!

Hi Ivan,

I'm Ivan - formerly with Kpler where I worked on MarineTraffic products after the acquisition. Now I'm building tools to simplify maritime compliance.

Lately, I've been talking to fleet managers about document tracking across vessels, and one pain point keeps coming up: expiring certificates and managing docs across fleets.

How's your team handling it - spreadsheets, manual checks, or something else?

No pitch - just genuinely curious. If you reply, I'll share anonymized insights from other managers. Either way, thanks for your time!
